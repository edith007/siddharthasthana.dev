title: GSoC Week 13 & Week 14 ‚Äî Making options in git-cat-file honor mailmap!
date: 2022-09-18

Well Hello friend üëãüèª

Last week, I got a 2-week extension on my GSoC timeline. Now, I can put that time on completing my git patches and look for bug fixes if any. After a lot of iterations and reviews from my mentors, I submitted my latest patch on [git mailing list](https://lore.kernel.org/git/). Let‚Äôs discuss about the implementation!

## The Problem

`git-cat-file` command supports two options called, `-s` and `--batch-check`, which return the size of the object that is passed to them. Gitaly uses the following command to get the size of all the objects in a git repo. Even though they can be combined with `--use-mailmap` option, it doesn‚Äôt have any effect on the size they report, as these options don‚Äôt report the size the object would have had if the idents were replaced using the mailmap mechanism. 

```bash
git cat-file --use-mailmap --batch-all-objects --batch-check --buffer --unordered
```

Now that Gitaly has the size of the objects, it can read that many bytes when it executes `git cat-file --use-mailmap -p <object-sha>`.

Now, let‚Äôs assume the size for a particular commit object as recorded by Gitaly is 600. But, let‚Äôs say that after replacing the idents using mailmap the object size that `git cat-file -use-mailmap -p <sha>` is 605. In such a scenario, Gitaly will only read 600 bytes instead of 605 bytes. This caused a lot of features to not work after adding `--use-mailmap` to `git cat-file` commands in Gitaly. 

The best way to solve the problem is by making `-s` and `--batch-check` honor the mailmap mechanism when used with `--use-mailmap` option. That is what I am currently implementing!

## Approach to solve the problem

We want `-s` and `--batch-check` options to honor mailmap when used with `--use-mailmap` option. In order to do that, they must read the commit/tag objects. The biggest challenge is to read the commit/tag object without sacrificing performance, as it can be an expensive operation.

Let‚Äôs see how `git cat-file -s <sha>` gets the size of the object. To understand, let's take a look at the first few lines of a function called `do_oid_object_info_extended()`. 

![Untitled](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edith007/siddharthasthana.dev/main/source/_posts/Week13%2614/Untitled.png)

As we can see, there is a call to function `find_cached_object()`. As the name suggests, it reads the cached git objects. Then, if we found a non-NULL cached object, we initialize various members of `object_info` structure if they are also not NULL. 

The `object_info` structure looks like the following:

![Untitled](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edith007/siddharthasthana.dev/main/source/_posts/Week13%2614/Untitled%201.png)

 So, the `object_info` structure has several members like `typep`, `sizep`, `contentp` and some more which are pointers. So, let‚Äôs say we want to get the size of an object, we first need to set the `sizep` field of `object_info` structure to point to a non-NULL location and then pass it to the `do_oid_object_info_extended()` function.

That‚Äôs pretty much how we get the size of an object when we execute `git cat-file -s <sha>`. There is just one variance that we don‚Äôt directly call `do_oid_object_info_extended()` function, instead we make a call to `oid_object_info_extended()` which is nothing but a wrapper for the `do_oid_object_info_extended()` function. But, I hope I am able to convey the idea here.

Just to make things crystal clear, here is the code which `-s` option of `git-cat-file` to get the size:

![Untitled](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edith007/siddharthasthana.dev/main/source/_posts/Week13%2614/Untitled%202.png)

Just, as we discussed, `oi` is nothing but an instance of the `object_info` structure. We first made it‚Äôs `sizep` field point to a variable called `size` and then call `oid_object_info_extended()` function, which populated the `oi.sizep` or `size` variable. And we simply print that to the stdout!

Now, as you might have guessed in order to make it honor the mailmap mechanism, we will have to read the object, for which we will need to read content of the object so that we can replace the idents on it and get the updated size. And to get the contents all we have to do is set the `contentp` field of `object_info` struct to point to a `char *` buffer and then call `oid_object_info_extended()`. But, just plainly reading the contents for every object can be expensive as `tree` and `blob` objects can be considerably larger than the `commit /tag` objects. So, it would really improve the performance if we could know the type of the object as well. And that is simple as well‚Ä¶ I am leaving that for you to guess üòÖ

Here is how I did it:

![Untitled](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edith007/siddharthasthana.dev/main/source/_posts/Week13%2614/Untitled%203.png)

I am setting the reading the type and contents of the object only when `-s` option is combined with `--use-mailmap` option. The function `replace_idents_using_mailmap()` reads the object, replaces idents with their canonical versions and updates the `size` of the object. That‚Äôs how I am enabled `-s` option to honor mailmap!

I followed a similar approach for `--batch-check` option as well! Here is the link to my patches in the mailing list: [https://lore.kernel.org/git/20220916205946.178925-1-siddharthasthana31@gmail.com/T/#t](https://lore.kernel.org/git/20220916205946.178925-1-siddharthasthana31@gmail.com/T/#t)

I am very grateful for my mentors, Christian and John, for helping me to improve and understand all of these things! I am forever grateful to them!! üôá
I have submitted my patches to Git‚Äôs mailing list as well. I am very happy to have received a very quick review from Junio as well. Thanks a lot, Junio!! üòÄ

I am currently working on improving the patches based on the reviews and will be sending the v2 very soon!

## **The road ahead** üõ£Ô∏è

So, my next task will be to:

- Improve my git patches.
- Verify all the features on GitLab work when we enable `--use-mailmap` option for `git-cat-file` commands in Gitaly. I have already tested the contribution graph and some commits. I am working on verifying other features as well!

So yeah, that was the week 13 & week 14. Can‚Äôt believe GSoC will be over the next week üò¢

Thanks a lot for reading üôÇ Will be back next week with another blog, Peace! ‚úåüèª
